 These functions are for VK_ or VKey Codes only!!! example: VK_F1 or VK_DELETE


                                    About: 

     This is a library LordJashin made from Delphi, that is loaded by OSI to
     extend SCAR and add some keyboard functions!
  
     At the moment, SCAR's KeyDown & KeyUp functions send SCAN CODES. But if
     you look at their params. They only allow a char to be in there, not
     a VKey. So we can't send a VKey as a Scan code with SCAR. Some games &
     applications will only accept the "simulated" input with the VKey sent 
     as a scan code, and that is what these functions are for.

     VKKeybdDown & VKKeybdUp: Use the Windows API - keybd_event function
     which has been superceded by

     VKSendKeyDown & VKSendKeyUp: Which both use SendInput API which superceded
     (should be used) over the Keybd_event function. 


     I provided both ways, just in case you wanted to try them out anyway, and
     to provide more...
